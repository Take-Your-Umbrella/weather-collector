# Weather Collection

## Overview

- This service collects real-time rain conditions in South Korea.

- It calls an external weather API (KMA) to fetch ultra-short-term forecast data, parses the response, and saves the
  parsed data to a database.

- It monitors the database size and automatically cleans up old data when a defined threshold is exceeded (data
  retention policy).
